# Document Parser
This program can parse the bill and create objected structure out of it that enables searching and printing. I developed recursive algorithm that recognises and divides each element by it's regex. I believe that it makes the code clean and the program universal.

## Running the program
You can run this program without arguments and then appropriate help will be shown.
